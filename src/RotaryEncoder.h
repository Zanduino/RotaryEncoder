@mainpage Arduino Library to access a rotary encoder

@section RotaryEncoder_section Description

This program defines the RotaryEncoder class header.

This program demonstrates the Rotary Encoder class which controls a commonly used rotary encoder
with a clear knob using 3 colored LEDs (Red, Green and Blue) along with a pushbutton. These are
available from sources such as https://www.sparkfun.com/products/10982 or
https://www.proto-pic.co.uk/rotary-encoder-illuminated-rgb.html along with numerous places on eBay,
Amazon and elsewhere. The product number is "EC12PSD-017" and it has two datasheets, one showing the
physical layout and allowing hookup of LEDs and pins, the other showing the timings of the
quadrature signature encoder itself.  The datasheets can be found referenced at the top-up
industries page for the encoder at
http://www.top-up.com.tw/front/bin/ptdetail.phtml?Part=EC12PLRGBSDVBF-D&Category=325301

Each Atmel processor has different pins available for interrupts, so the choice of pins to use for
the ROTARY_PIN_1, ROTARY_PIN_2 and PUSHBUTTON_PIN is quite limited. A good description of the pins
and their uses can be found at https://www.arduino.cc/en/Reference/AttachInterrupt.

The library uses the Arduino functions "digitalRead()" to get pin state in the interrupt handlers.
These are relatively slow compared to the direct register reading methods available. Since the
library is designed for a hand-turned encoder versus a high-speed machine with thousands of RPM the
slower functions have been retained for more portability and legibility. Going directly to the
PORTA, PORTB, etc. register reads would make the pin mapping that needs to be done too complex.

The rotary encoder has a common cathode (+) for the 3 LED lights. The pins for the 3 colors need to
be attached to any 3 available PWM pins (not all of the Atmel pins are PWM, see
https://www.arduino.cc/en/Tutorial/PWM) and since these pins to be driven to ground, a value of 255
equates to "OFF" while a value of 0 equates to "ON".  The encoder doesn't have any current limiting
resistors for the 3 LEDs, so these need to be added. The forward voltage for the red is 2.0V and the
green/blue LEDs have 3.3V and with a 25mA current that equates to resistors at 120 and 68 Ohms
respectively.

The pushbutton should have a pull-down resistor of 4.7KOhm to reduce bounce. The sample breadboard
schematic used for the examples for this library can be located at in Github at the following
address: https://github.com/Zanduino/RotaryEncoder/blob/master/Images/RotaryEncoder.png

Although programming for the Arduino and in c/c++ is new to me, I'm a professional programmer and
have learned, over the years, that it is much easier to ignore superfluous comments than it is to
decipher non-existent ones; so both my comments and variable names tend to be verbose. The code is
written to fit in the first 80 spaces and the comments start after that and go to column 100 -
allowing the code to be printed in A4 landscape mode. There are several parts of code which can be
somewhat optimized, but in order to make the c++ code more understandable by non-programmers some
performance has been sacrificed for legibility and maintainability.

@section doxygen configuration
This library is built with the standard "Doxyfile", which is located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/blob/main/Doxygen. As described on that page, there are only 5
environment variables used, and these are set in the project's actions file, located at
https://github.com/Zanduino/RotaryEncoder/blob/master/.github/workflows/ci-doxygen.yml
Edit this file and set the 5 variables: PRETTYNAME, PROJECT_NAME, PROJECT_NUMBER, PROJECT_BRIEF and
PROJECT_LOGO so that these values are used in the doxygen documentation.
The local copy of the doxyfile should be in the project's root directory in order to do local
doxygen testing, but the file is ignored on upload to GitHub.

@section clang-format
Part of the GitHub actions for CI is running every source file through "clang-format" to ensure
that coding formatting is done the same for all files. The configuration file ".clang-format" is
located at https://github.com/Zanduino/Common/tree/main/clang-format and this is used for CI tests
when pushing to GitHub. The local file, if present in the root directory, is ignored when
committing and uploading.
